# Beta Builds for reOA
Want to get to reOA builds early? This is your holy grail then! Beta server software, Beta Front-end and more will be here

To download just go to the releases tab and download the Backend software (Patched front-end when i add enough backend for it to actually work)

For now, Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/xV6QHWMUV8) for more info, you will also get pinged when first beta releases!

Want to download early? [Download the source code](https://github.com/OARevival/BetaBuilds/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and get new updated before anyone else (even though buggy)
